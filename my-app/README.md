# My Assignment
# Question 2

The signficant features of react are: 
JSX(JavaScript Syntax Extension) 
Vistual DOM 
Performance
One-way data binding
Extensions

# Question 3

Advantages of react: 
Reusable components
React is easy to learn 
Easy creation of dynamic applications
Improved Performance
Dedicated tools for easy debugging

# Question 4

React was created by Jordan Walke, owned by Facebook.

# Question 5

You need to return a single parent element in JSX
You can implement JS directly in JSX
All tags Self-close in JSX
All HTML Attributes should be camelCase in JSX
All Inline Styles should be written as an Object in JSX

# Question 6

Browsers can't read JSX because there is no inherent implementation for the browser engines to read and understand them. JSX is not intended to be implemented by engines or browsers, it is intended to be used by various transpilers to transform these JSX into valid JavaScript code.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
